LC 1401. Circle and Rectangle Overlapping
Code:
class Solution:
    def checkOverlap(self, radius: int, xCenter: int, yCenter: int, x1: int, y1: int, x2: int, y2: int) -> bool:
        nearest_x = max(x1, min(x2, xCenter))
        nearest_y = max(y1, min(y2, yCenter))
        dist_x = nearest_x - xCenter
        dist_y = nearest_y - yCenter

        return dist_x ** 2 + dist_y ** 2 <= radius ** 2
LC 1823. Find the Winner of the Circular Game
Code:
class Solution:
    def findTheWinner(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        circle: list[int] = [num for num in range(1, n + 1, 1)]
        cur_ind: int = 0

        while len(circle) != 1:
            next_to_remove: int = (cur_ind + k - 1) % len(circle)
            circle.pop(next_to_remove)
            cur_ind = next_to_remove

        return circle[0]
